# Modelling Networks

This content is ready to go! As usual, create a CodeSpace or work locally use the DevContainers plugin and Docker Desktop. The virutal environment should be selected by default this time, so try running the code right away. ðŸ˜Ž If not, select the Poetry environment. It make need a couple of minutes to fully load.

Note that some cells in the Enron notebook will take some time to run. (Especially Models 3-4.) Some plotting commands will also be a bit slow, but we should be able to run things in the live session together without issue.

See you in class!
